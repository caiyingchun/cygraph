"""
Various graph-theory related algorithm implementations using cygraph classes.

Currently includes:
 - Shortest Path (Dijkstra's algorithm)
 - Minimum spanning tree (Bor≈Øvka's algorithm)
 - Graph partition (Karger's algorithm)
 - Number of components (depth-first search)

    Takes a graph and finds the shortest path between two vertices in it.
    
    Args:
        cygraph.graph.Graph graph: A graph.
        v1: One of the vertices in the inputted graph.
        v2: The other vertex in the inputted graph.
    
    Returns:
        The list of vertices that constitute the shortest path

    Raises:
        ValueError: One of the vertices is not in the graph.

    Finds the minimum spanning tree of a graph.

    Args:
        cygraph.graph.Graph graph: A graph.
    
    Returns:
        The graph that is the minimum spanning tree of the inputted graph.

    Partitions a graph into two graphs.

    Returns:
        A tuple of two graphs that are the result of a random partition

    Gets the components of the inputted graph, where a component is a
