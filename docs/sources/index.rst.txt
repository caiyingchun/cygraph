Cygraph documentation
===================================

Cygraph is a graph theory library implemented in Cython_. Its main purpose is to be a fast alternative to networkx_ for developers using Cython; however, it still has a simple Python API. I am not accepting any contributions currently, since this project is still in its very early stages.
